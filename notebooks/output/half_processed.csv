Upon arriving from a curved Blackbutt deck that sweeps around a stand of tangled Messmates, one enters into a glazed 2.5 storey atrium and into the open plan living, dining and kitchen area. This unique and distinctive space form the 'heart of the house', with soaring 4.2m high ceilings, curved walls and large picture windows that outlook to a distant view over the forest. The design manages to provide complete privacy, yet the roof soars above the contours of the land to over 9m high.

This bespoke dwelling has been designed for modern ecologically-sustainable living that reflects the adventurous lifestyle of the Surf Coast. As an 'architects-own' residence, no expense or effort was spared, with the house exquisitely designed and detailed for low-maintenance, sustainable living. Master built using bagged brickwork, Colorbond walls, galvanised steel expressed beams and columns, double-glazed anodised aluminium windows and lined with fire-rated plasterboard, this home is built to last 100 years.

The large open kitchen, dining and living room are anchored by Jarrah hardwood floors, a perfect reflection of the vibrant hues of the Australian landscape. The kitchen has stainless-steel benches and Tasmanian Myrtle Burl touches, black 2-pack cupboards and Cypress Pine beams lining the ceiling. Striking interiors and timber finishes abound, complementing the northern treetop outlook from the open plan living space. Naturally-warmed by the sun, the whole house is heated by a wood-fired hydronic system. A north-facing deck from this living space provides sunset views over the forest to the distant horizon, while multiple sheltered decks, terraces and bush tracks allow you to spend time outdoors and enjoy the untouched ecosystem of indigenous flora and fauna.

From the upper-level living room, an ideal work-from-home study space is revealed with two flexibly-planned large bedrooms ideal for children or guests. The large fully-tiled bathroom, complete with open shower and relaxing bath, connects to a private deck, post-surf shower and Finnish-style cedar sauna. Descending the stylish spiral stairway atrium to a pebbled Japanese-inspired 'indoor-outdoor' space through Shoji doors, a parent's retreat is revealed: sitting area, bathroom and two large bedrooms, each with a private deck or courtyard and outlook over the lawn to the ironbark forest. This is complemented by a huge laundry and under-floor storage space. The whole house has recently been refreshed, with new carpets, Jarrah floorboards and decks, fresh paint, and new kitchen appliances.

The main residence is complemented by a separate 60 sqm. studio, complete with kitchenette, bar and bathroom. This multi-purpose space features Hoop Pine plywood lining, exposed Cypress Pine beams and custom-designed joinery, with windows offering a slice of view to the forest and a private terrace. This adaptable space provides the perfect designer space for work-from-home office, a yoga, artist or music studio, and guest accommodation.

The house is set back from Bells Boulevard and protected from view by two sheds: one is large enough (12 x 8 x 4.5m high) to operate your business from, or store a car collection, RV's or boats. The landscaping reflects the character of the Bells Beach hinterland, with gravel pathways, rock gardens, sandstone-paved courtyards and an expansive 500 sqm. Sir Walter Buffalo turfed lawn. With 95,000 litres of water storage, Aqua nova septic system and 6.5 kW solar system, this dwelling is low-energy, low maintenance and partially off-grid. The forest is abundant with indigenous vegetation and a host of wildlife that includes magpies, parrots, visiting wood ducks, kookaburras, wallabies and echidnas. Living within 10 minutes of Torquay for shopping, and even closer to Jan Juc and Bells Beach. 42 Bells Boulevard achieves the perfect balance between accessibility and privacy.

This is a stunning and exciting coastal home set within minutes from the world-famous Bells Beach surfing reserve.

The substantial 1350sqm allotment has large lawn areas with a comfortable contour for family use and is quite protected from afternoon sea breezes. The residence has been very cleverly designed to make the most of the view on the ocean side and maximise the natural light of the northern aspect on the inland side.
